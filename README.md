# Rössler Attractor Simulation in MATLAB

## Introduction

This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate and visualize the Rössler Attractor in 3D. The Rössler Attractor is a well-known chaotic dynamical system that exhibits intricate and complex behavior. This simulation uses the Euler method to numerically integrate the system's equations and visualize the resulting trajectory.

dx/dt = -y - z

dy/dt = x + a * y

dz/dt = b + z * (x - c)
